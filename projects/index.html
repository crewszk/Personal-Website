                <h2>Pizza Ordering Application</h2>
                <p>
                    This project was initially the final project for my JU Application Development class. It was developed in C# using Microsoft Windows Forms. It includes
                    checking for an internet connection and sending an email to the user after order completion that contains the receipt for the order.active. 
                    I've improved on it a little but have since abandoned it for the time being and carries a few known bugs.

                <p>
                    This project is the one you're currently looking at! Its a personal website mirroring my resume for practice in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It works as a
                    personalized and interactive hub for my school progress and projects. I plan on implementing JavaScript frameworks in different variations of the website
                    like BootStrap and React to enhance my JavaScript skills.
