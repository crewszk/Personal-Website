# Personal Website
## Used for exploring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This is my personal website that at first glace is a website version of my resume but I mainly
use it to explore HTML, CSS, and JavaScript technologies to better myself on the front end
development of websites. My hope is that through this website I can show employers what I am
currently able to do and that I'm actively learning.
